## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- How to create general utility classes for common properties like font size, family etc., and change them using 
media queries and custom properties
- practice using grid to place items in different order with respect to viewport sizes

## Acknowledgments

I used the idea to use custom properties with general utilities classes and change the custom properties  with media 
queries from [ 
Kevin Powell's 
videos ](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob) because it saved so much time and code repetition as well as keep the code 
very organised and 
very easy it 
is to change the values in the future.
